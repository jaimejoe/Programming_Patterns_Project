## Description
A food ordering system where Users order food through a GUI, while admins will be able to 
process and manage said orders. Users would also be able to make a decision to have the order as 
a combo which would reduce the price in opposed to ordering the items individually. There will also
be discount codes, which would also reduce the price (only 1 at a time).
